## UX Development <a name="uxdev"></a>
### Project Goals

This site is to support a beauty business, By Samantha Brooker, which operates in the Thurrock area of Essex. Sam runs a mobile beauty business and has mainly been relying on her Facebook page to drive business. The website will give her more control over the information available to customers and to allow them to contact her should they wish to employ her services.

After an initial consultation with Sam we have been able to identify the following possible features that she would like to have available and that customers would expect to see when visiting and using the site.

### User Goals

The process for creating the site for the client can be found [here](#) for reference.

### User Stories
The users for this site will be women. As the site at this stage is a static site without functionality, all users will be classed as **site visitor**. For user stories to cater for future features we would introduce a **client** user. This would be a user that is registered with the site and is looking to interact in some way i.e. make or amend a booking.

- As a **site visitor**, I want to find a **list of services** so that I can **find the treatment I require**
- As a **site visitor**, I want to find the **prices for the treatments** available so I can **understand the cost of a treatment and any offers**
- As a **site visitor**, I want to find **contact details** so that I can **enquire about a treatment or a potential booking**
- As a **site visitor** I want to find **more about the business practice** so that I can **understand what makes this different from other businesses**
- As a **site visitor**, I want to find information on **how the business is going to manage with COVID** so I am confident **I can book safely**
- As a **site visitor** I  want to find **customer testimonials** to help understand **quality of service**
- As a **site visitor** I want to find links to the **business social media** and see other customers reactions and satisfaction to **verify quality of service**
- As a **site visitor** I want to find information on **why waxing would be better than other methods of hair removal** to understand **level of experience** of business
- As a **site visitor** I want to find information on the **locations that this business operates in** so that I can understand if **I can book a treatment**

### Site Owner Goals
The site owner has the following goals that they wish to achieve from this project:
- Show what the **business is about**
- Highlight the **uniqueness of business - Sam herself**. A customer will be seen by her **personally** each time.
- Linked with **Sam’s social media channels** to showcase customer / service quality & scope to build a **level of trust**
- Allow customers to **make contact with Sam** for general enquiries
- Allow customers to **make a booking**
- Be mobile friendly with a **responsive layout design** for a smooth desktop experience
- Be **clean and simple** in design and not be perceived as overloaded and cluttered with excessive content
- Allow customers to **make full or part payments** and track this for easy management of bookings and payments


### User Requirements & Expectations

### Design Choices
#### Fonts 
#### Icons
#### Colours

### Site Map and Wireframes
To help ensure that the site contains all of the required information I have created simple wireframes as a framework, using the User Stories and Site Owner Goals to ensure that all of the required features for this release are present.

The site is made up of 5 pages, which are shown in the below sitemap:

![Sitemap](wireframe/sitemap.png)

All of the wireframes were created mobile first, with subsequent wireframes showing the view on a tablet and desktop.
Below is the wireframe for the Home page in mobile view.

![homepagemobileview](wireframe/homemobileview.png)

As the Contact Me section isn't a page but a modal, you can see how this will behave below. Each of the other pages and device views can be found using the links that follow:

![contactmemobileview](wireframe/contactmemobileview.png)

- Home page: [Tablet](wireframe/hometabletview.png) | [Desktop](wireframe/homedesktopview.png)
- Treatments page: [Mobile](wireframe/treatmentsmobileview.png) | [Tablet](wireframe/treatmentstabletview.png) | [Desktop](wireframe/treatmentsdesktopview.png)
- Why Wax page: [Mobile](wireframe/) | [Tablet](wireframe/) | [Desktop](wireframe/)
- COVID-19: [Mobile](wireframe/covidmobileview.png) | [Tablet](wireframe/covidtabletview.png) | [Desktop](wireframe/coviddesktopview.png)
- About: [Mobile](wireframe/aboutmobileview.png) | [Tablet](wireframe/abouttabletview.png) | [Desktop](wireframe/aboutdesktopview.png)
- Contact (modal): [Tablet](wireframe/contacttabletview.png) | [Desktop](wireframe/contactdesktopview.png)

### **Features & Future Releases**
Based on what Sam is looking to achieve and what customers would expect to achieve from visiting her site, a fully functional site should contain the following features to be relevant and fit the needs:

- Show what the business is about
- Highlight the uniqueness of business - Sam herself. A customer will be seen by her personally each time.

- Be mobile friendly with a responsive layout design for a smooth desktop experience
