### User Requirements & Expectations

### Wireframes
To help ensure that the site contains all of the required information I have created simple wireframes as a framework, using the User Stories and Site Owner Goals to ensure that all of the required features for this release are present.

The site is made up of 5 pages, which are shown in the below sitemap:
![Sitemap](wireframe/sitemap.png)

All of the wireframes were created mobile first, with subsequent wireframes showing the view on a tablet and desktop.
The wireframes show:
- Home page
- Treatments page
- Why Wax page
- COVID-19
- About

Below is the wireframe for the Home page, each of the others can be found following the links in the list above.
