                        <h2>Before your service:</h2>
                        <p>
                            What is a patch test and consultation?
                            First of all it’s a great opportunity to meet me in person and make you feel at ease. A small amount of tint is applied behind the ear for 3 minutes to check for any reaction. For brow lamination you keep the cream on for 24 hrs before washing off.
                            We talk through how to get the best possible brow for your face shape together so that you are really happy. Lastly we talk through a list of contra indications so that we can be sure waxing is suitable for you.

                            How much is a patch test and consultation?
                            Absolutely nothing at all.

                            What if I have a reaction or it's unsuitable to wax me?
                            We can discuss next steps together. If you would prefer we can tweeze instead of waxing and I can show you how to use product instead of tinting.

                            Do I really need a tint?
                            During the 1980s women were encouraged to shave off their eyebrows and draw thm back on with pencil, in the 1990s – 2000s we still lusted after a thinner eyebrow. This has left a generation of us with patchy brows with gaps we don’t seem to be able to grow back in.
                            To solve this and to get a fuller brow the best thing to do is have a wax AND tint! The wax cleans up the soft, downy hair giving what brow you do have a cleaner, fuller appearance and the tint clings to every tiny hair – even the ones you think you can’t see – to build a fuller brow.
                            
                            How long should I leave my hair to grow for a body or intimate wax?
                            Ideally hair needs to be between 1/2cm – 1cm for optimum results. The time will differ for everyone but if you’ve been shaving youll need to wait at least two weeks before attempting to wax, sometimes much longer

                        <h2>During Your Service:</h2>
                        <p>
                            What do I need to provide?
                            All I need is a small table which is clear, kitchen side that's within 5 metres of a plug socket. (I fetch an extension lead). You will need to clean this area before I set up using disinfectant and disposable kitchen roll or paper towel.
                            You'll also want something to sit on, preferably a dining chair/bar stool or similar.

                            What if I am feeling embarrassed about my hair/body?
                            A good therapist will not have any time to judge because they are focused on giving you the quickest, effective and painless service possible.
                            A great therapist will never see anything except hair direction and skin to know which way they are removing the hair.
                            The best therapist will do all of the above while making you feel great about yourself too!

                            Do I need a babysitter? Can you style my brows with my children here?
                            I have two children of my own so I know how hard it can be to get to a salon. Your children are more than welcome to stay with you while I'm doing your service. Following updated guidance following COVID – 19 children are no longer able to sit on your laps or “help”. You may find that if needed additional supervision will help you to enjoy your service more.

                        <h2>After Your Service:</h2>
                        <p>
                            How long will the results last?
                            Results can vary from person to person and will depend on what skin type you are, what products you use on your face and what environmental factors impact your regrowth. As well as taking into consideration hair growth time and the thickness of the hair.
                            As a very general rule the below applies –
                            Brow tinting – Up to 4 weeks
                            Brow Waxing - Up to 4 weeks
                            Brow Lamination – Up to 6 weeks
                            Facial Waxing – Up to 6 weeks
                            Body waxing – Up to 6 weeks

                            Please remember that results can vary from person to person and a client with fair hair who has been waxing for years may only need 6-8 intimate waxes a year whereas a client with darker hair who has never waxed may find every 3 weeks better for their treatments.

                            What should I do in between waxing?
                            The best thing to do is to leave the regrowth alone! Sometimes when styling your brows I may leave a few hairs that look out of place but they are part of the bigger picture to building your perfect brow shape. If you have to tweeze a stray hair, try to leave the start, arch and end of the brow alone.

                            If you find that you suffer with ingrown hairs following your first few intimate or body waxes use a gentle exfoliator on the area 2-3 times a week. Never attempt to ‘dig’ a hair out as this can cause infection and permanent scaring.

                            How do I book?
                            Please drop me a message using the contact me button here. A full consultation and patch test is offered to every new client free of charge.

                            I’m on medication, can I still have a service?
                            Every client will be sent a simple, confidential survey to complete before their treatment. This will highlight any medication to me and I can then advise on the next steps. For most medications we can continue as normal but a small amount may mean that we need to make some adjustments.
                            What’s best, waxing, threading or tweezing?
                            (use image here)
                            Waxing is by far the most effective and quickest way to remove hair right from the root.
                            Threading can be unpredictable, sometimes snapping the hair and causing ingrown hairs or sometimes removing hair that was meant to still be there.
                            Tweezing is controllable but time consuming as each hair is pulled out individually.

                            Top Three Waxing Myths:
                            Waxing doesn’t work for me.
                            Your hair will grow back at different rates for the first few waxes. Especially if you’ve been shaving as you will have all the hairs on different growth cycles. Never judge on one leg wax before your holiday in 2016. For best results, have 2-3 waxes before your holiday to ensure maximum results and hair free time.

                            Body Waxing is too painful.
                            Everyone has different pain thresholds. I use a honey and argan oil wax for soft body hair such as legs and arms and a sensitive hot wax for stubborn hair such as intimate and underarms. Good technique shouldn’t hurt you and you should definitely never bruise from waxing.

                            Hair comes back darker and thicker.
                            If this was true, the minute men started to recede they would begin to wax!
                            As all the hair comes through at once after a few weeks of hair free time you sometimes have the illusions of this myth. However over time, hair becomes softer and thinner.
